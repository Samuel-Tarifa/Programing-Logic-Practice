Build a searchbox component that filters results. As you type into the search input, the list beneath it gets filtered. If the entered text doesn't match any item in the list simply show "no matches". As you type into the search box, the magnifying glass icon changes into a cross. Clicking the cross deletes the entered text and takes you back to the initial state.

Bonus if the string that is being searched for is bolded in the results.
